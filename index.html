			What’s a version control system? 
		</h1>
			<p>
				A version control system, or VCS, tracks
			the history of changes as people and teams collaborate on projects
			together. As the project evolves, teams can run tests, fix bugs, and
			contribute new code with the confidence that any version can be recovered
			at any time. Developers can review project history to find out: 
			<ul>
				<li>Which changes were made?</li> 
			<li>Who made the changes?</li> 
			<li>When were the changes made?</li>
				<li>Why were changes needed?</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<h3>What’s a distributed version control system?</h3>

<p>Git is an example of a distributed version control system (DVCS) commonly used for open source and commercial software development. DVCSs allow full access to every file, branch, and iteration of a project, and allows every user access to a full and self-contained history of all changes. Unlike once popular centralized version control systems, DVCSs like Git don’t need a constant connection to a central repository. Developers can work anywhere and collaborate asynchronously from any time zone.</p>
